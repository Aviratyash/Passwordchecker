# Password Strength Checker

This Python script evaluates the strength of passwords based on various criteria such as length, complexity, and character diversity. It provides a score and categorizes the strength into weak, moderate, or strong, along with recommendations for improvement.

## Features

- Assess the strength of passwords.
- Categorize password strength as weak, moderate, or strong.
- Provide recommendations for improving password strength.

## How it Works

The password strength checker employs a scoring system that evaluates the following aspects of a password:
- Length: Longer passwords are generally stronger.
- Complexity: Use of a mix of lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and special characters.
- Uniqueness: Avoiding common dictionary words or easily guessable patterns.

The script calculates a score based on these criteria and categorizes the password's strength accordingly. It also offers suggestions on how to enhance the password's security.

## Usage

To use the password strength checker, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the `password_analyser.py` script.
2. Run the script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python password_analyser.pyw
